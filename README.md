**Galaxy** is an ultra high-performance Bitcoin SV (BSV) node built in Rust, designed to unboundedly scale to asynchronously parallel process over **100,000,000 transactions per second (TPS)** per shard. It leverages a microservices architecture with a novel asyncTCP implementation written from the ground-up for ultra-fast, asynchronous communication. Featuring a bespoke Tiger Beetle DB for scalable UTXO storage, and Rust SV for BSV-specific libraries to power OP_RETURN data, private blockchain overlays, and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs.

## üåü Features

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.88+ (stable)
- Cargo
- Tiger Beetle server (for `storage_service`, see [Tiger Beetle](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle))
- `sled` for overlay and index storage
- `prometheus`, `governor`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `tracing` for metrics, rate limiting, auth, and logging

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/murphsicles/Galaxy.git
cd Galaxy
cargo build
```

### Running Services
Start each service in a separate terminal:
```bash
cd network_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd transaction_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd block_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd storage_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd consensus_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd overlay_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd validation_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd mining_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd auth_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd alert_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd index_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd api_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd torrent_service
cargo run
```
```bash
cd merchant_service
cargo run
```

### Tiger Beetle Setup
For `storage_service`, start a Tiger Beetle server:
```bash
tigerbeetle start --cluster=0 --replica=0
```

### Authentication Setup
Configure a secure JWT secret key in `tests/config.toml` under `[auth]`. Generate tokens with roles (`client`, `miner`) for testing.

## üß™ Testing

Test services using a TCP client or custom scripts with `bincode` serialization, including JWT tokens for authentication. Ensure all services are running on their respective ports:
- `api_service`: `localhost:50050`
- `network_service`: `localhost:50051`
- `transaction_service`: `localhost:50052`
- `storage_service`: `localhost:50053`
- `block_service`: `localhost:50054`
- `consensus_service`: `localhost:50055`
- `overlay_service`: `localhost:50056`
- `validation_service`: `localhost:50057`
- `mining_service`: `localhost:50058`
- `index_service`: `localhost:50059`
- `auth_service`: `localhost:50060`
- `alert_service`: `localhost:50061`
- `torrent_service`: `localhost:50062`
- `merchant_service`: `localhost:50063`

### Testnet Integration
Galaxy is configured to connect to BSV testnet nodes. See `tests/config.toml` for settings:
- Testnet nodes for `network_service`.
- Tiger Beetle server address for `storage_service`.
- Sharding parameters and node mappings.
- Authentication settings.
- Alert and indexing configurations.
- Overlay consensus rules (e.g., `restrict_op_return`).
- Torrent service configurations for sybil resistance and chunk sizing.
- Test cases for all services, including `torrent_service` with mocked dependencies.

Run the full pipeline test:
```bash
cd tests
chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh
```

### Metrics
Monitor performance using the `GetMetrics` endpoint on each service (e.g., `localhost:50057` for `validation_service`, dynamic port for `torrent_service` in tests):
```bash
# Example TCP client or custom script needed for bincode+tokio communication
# Use a tool like netcat or a custom Rust client to send GetMetrics requests
```
Metrics include:
- `*_requests_total`: Total requests per service (e.g., `block_requests_total`, `torrent_requests_total`).
- `*_latency_ms`: Average request latency (ms).
- `*_alert_count`: Total alerts sent.
- `*_index_throughput`: Indexed items per second (where applicable).
- `*_cache_hits`: Cache hits (e.g., `validation_cache_hits`).
- `errors_total`: Total errors (placeholder, currently 0).

### Alerts
Subscribe to alerts using the `alert_service` with a TCP client:
```bash
# Use a custom Rust client or TCP tool to send AlertRequest with bincode serialization
```

### Logging
View logs with the `tracing` crate at the `INFO` level (configurable in `tests/config.toml` under `[metrics][log_level]`).

See individual service READMEs for detailed test commands, including `torrent_service/README.md` for torrent-specific tests.

## üîÑ CI/CD

Galaxy uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:
- **Build**: Compiles the project in release mode.
- **Formatting**: Ensures code adheres to `rustfmt` standards.
- **Linting**: Runs `clippy` for code quality.
- **Dependency Checks**: Validates dependencies with `cargo outdated`.
- **Tests**: Runs unit and integration tests, starting dependent services, including `torrent_service` with mocked block, overlay, validation, transaction, auth, alert, storage, and proof services.

Check the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) for details.

## üìà Performance Highlights

Galaxy is optimized for ultra-high performance:
